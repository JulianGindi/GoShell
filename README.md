GoShell
=======

A toy shell written in Go

## Objective

The goal of this project is to create a minimal, fast, and highly concurrent shell environment.

## Features

The following are some of the planned features:

- Native piping
- Easy support for executing shell commands as a non-blocking background process (prepend the '&' character to the command)
- Robust command and location history system
- Customizable shell prompt
- Environment variables 
- A simple shell-scripting language (inspired by Python)

## Custom Unix Programs

I will be adapting some classic Unix programs to Go as an exercise. This will also allow me to add concurrency to programs that might not already have it. The user will have the option to use the original version, or the "Go optimized" version.
