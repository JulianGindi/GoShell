GoShell
=======

A toy shell written in Go

## Objective

The goal of this project is to create a minimal, fast, and highly concurrent shell environment.

## Features

The following are some of the planned features:

- Native piping
- Easy support for executing shell commands as a non-blocking background process (prepend the '&' character to the command)
- Robust command and location history system
- Customizable shell prompt
- Environment variables 
- A simple shell-scripting language (inspired by Python)
